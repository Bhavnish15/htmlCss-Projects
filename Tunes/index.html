        <h1>What is Music</h1>
        <h3>
          Its an Art, Music is generally defined as the art of arranging <br />
          sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm
          <br />
          or otherwise expressive content.

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <h4>
          In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some
          extent improvised. For instance, in Hindustani classical music, the
          performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined
          structure and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz the
          performers may take turns leading and responding, while sharing a
          changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no
          structure whatsoever, with each performer acting at their discretion.
          Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable, or
          agglomerated electronically from many performances.

          Music often plays a key role in social activities, religious rituals,
          rite of passage ceremonies, celebrations, and cultural activities. The
          music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers,
          producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories,
          and sheet music. Compositions, performances, and recordings are
          assessed and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music
          scholars, as well as amateurs.

      <h2>This is Soul Music</h2>
      <p>
        Music as an art of the theatre has its roots in primitive ritual and
        ceremony and its branches in every modern means of theatrical
        presentation. Its functions are as varied as the forms require and range
        from being the primary reason for performance, as in opera, to mere
        noise, filling a vacuum in imagination for some screen and stage
        presentations. Theatre music is all music composed to govern, enhance,
        or support a theatrical conception. Music composed for theatrical
        purposes obeys different laws than does the music for concert
        performance or conventional opera. Whereas in opera the music dictates
        the form in which the dramatic visual imagery is presented and governs
        its development, in other kinds of theatre the music is, at best, an
        equal partner among its principal elements. In concert, of course, the
        music is the sole factor that determines the experience.
