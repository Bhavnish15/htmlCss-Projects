        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language
          which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an
          interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic
          interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was
          introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the
          Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all
          other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern
          web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every
          time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of
          interactivity and simplicity. <br />
          Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming
          language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java
          was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers,
          databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their
          scripting and query language.

        <h1>Hisory of JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
          In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence.
          In the year 1994, Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. He realized
          that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language'
          was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for
          designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the
          company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme
          programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start,
          the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its
          Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web
          technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and
          the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar
          name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'.
          Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of
          Javascript named 'Mocha'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name
          with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other
          reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to
          'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came into existence.

        <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
        <p>
          Before starting this module, you don't need any previous JavaScript
          knowledge, but you should have some familiarity with HTML and CSS. You
          are advised to work through the following modules before starting on
          JavaScript:

      <div class="jsandjava" id="javaScriptandjava">
        <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
        <p>
          Many users think that Java and java-script are similar languages, or
          they are two different names of the same language. But the user has to
          clear his doubt that java-script and java language are not similar
          languages, and java-script has nothing to do with the java programming
          language. The main reason for introducing the scripting language as
          JavaScript is the popularity of java programming language that was at
          its peak at that time. To get the advantage of the popularity of the
          term "java" in the java programming language , it was introduced as
          JavaScript
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="helloworld" id="helloWrold">
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>
          A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints Hello, World! on the
          screen. Since it's a very simple program, this program is often used
          to introduce a new programming language to beginners.
        </p>
        <em>// the hello world program</em>
        <span>console.log('Hello World');</span>
      </div>

      <div class="externaljavascript" id="externaljavascript">
        <h1>External JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
          We can create external JavaScript file and embed it in many html page.
          <br />

          It provides code re usability because single JavaScript file can be
          used in several html pages. <br />

          An external JavaScript file must be saved by .js extension. It is
          recommended to embed all JavaScript files into a single file. It
          increases the speed of the webpage. Let's create an external
          JavaScript file that prints Hello Javatpoint in a alert dialog box.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="comment" id="comments">
        <h1>Comments</h1>
        <p>
          The JavaScript comments are meaningful way to deliver message. It is
          used to add information about the code, warnings or suggestions so
          that end user can easily interpret the code. The JavaScript comment is
          ignored by the JavaScript engine i.e. embedded in the browser.
        </p>
        <h3>Advantages of JavaScript comments</h3>
        <p>
          <strong> To make code easy to understand</strong> It can be used to
          elaborate the code so that end user can easily understand the code.
          <br />
          <strong> To avoid the unnecessary code </strong> It can also be used
          to avoid the code being executed. Sometimes, we add the code to
          perform some action. But after sometime, there may be need to disable
          the code. In such case, it is better to use comments.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Comments</h2>
        <h3>There are Two Types of Comments</h3>

        <p>
          Single-line Comment <br />
          Multi-line Comment
        </p>

      <div class="variable" id="variables">
        <h1>Variables</h1>
        <p>
          A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. <br />
          There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and
          global variable.
        </p>
        <em
          >var x = 10; <br />
          var _value="sonoo";
        </em>
      </div>

      <div class="datatype" id="datatypes">
        <h1>Data Types</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of
          values. <br />
          There are two types of data types in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Primitive data type <br />
          Non-primitive (reference) data type
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify
          type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript
          engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold
          any type of values such as numbers, strings etc. <br />
          For example:
          <em
            >var a=40;//holding number <br />
            var b="Rahul";//holding string
          </em>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="operator" id="operators">
        <h1>Operators</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations
          on operands. <br />
          For example:
          <em>var sum=10+20; </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, + is the arithmetic operator and = is the assignment operator.
          <br />There are following types of operators in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arithmetic Operators <br />
          Comparison (Relational) Operators <br />
          Bitwise Operators <br />
          Logical Operators <br />
          Assignment Operators <br />
          Special Operators
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="conditional" id="conditionalstatements">
        <h1>Conditional Statements</h1>
        <h2>JavaScript If-else</h2>
        <p>
          The JavaScript if-else statement is used to execute the code whether
          condition is true or false. There are three forms of if statement in
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Statement <br />
          If else statement <br />
          if else if statement
        </p>
        <h2>JavaScript Switch</h2>
        <p>
          The JavaScript switch statement is used to execute one code from
          multiple expressions. It is just like else if statement that we have
          learned in previous page. But it is convenient than if..else..if
          because it can be used with numbers, characters etc.
        </p>
        <em>
          switch(expression){ <br />
          case value1: <br />
          code to be executed; <br />
          break; <br />
          case value2: <br />
          code to be executed; <br />
          break; <br />
          ...... <br />

          default: <br />
          code to be executed if above values are not matched; <br />
          }
        </em>
      </div>

      <div class="loop java" id="loops">
        <h1>Loops in JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
          The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for,
          while, do while or for-in loops. It makes the code compact. It is
          mostly used in array.
        </p>
        <h2>There are four types of loops in JavaScript.</h2>
        <p>
          for loop <br />
          while loop <br />
          do-while loop <br />
          for-in loop
        </p>
        <em
          >for (initialization; condition; increment) <br />

      <em
        >do{ <br />
        code to be executed <br />
        }while (condition);
      </em>

      <div class="function" id="functions">
        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript functions are used to perform operations. We can call
          JavaScript function many times to reuse the code.
        </p>
        <p>There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions.</p>
        <p>
          <strong> Code reusability: </strong>We can call a function several
          times so it save coding <strong> Less coding:</strong> It makes our
          program compact. We don’t need to write many lines of code each time
          to perform a common task.
        </p>
        <em
          >function functionName([arg1, arg2, ...argN]){ <br />
